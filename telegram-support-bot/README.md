Since version v4 this bot uses the grammY Telegram Bot Framework instead of the telegraf framework for various reasons.

### Upgrading to v4.0.0

Make sure you add the new settings strings to your config.yaml file. Check the config-sample.yaml for all configs.
Here are some of the new settings that you should add when migrating:

    parse_mode: 'Markdown' # DO NOT CHANGE!
    autoreply: (see config-sample.yaml for an example)

The config-sample.yaml settings now all use markdown instead of HTML so you have to adjust that. e.g. instead of <br/> line break use \n instead. For a full list check the telegram bot API docs.

Upgrade to the new version. e.g. by pulling the main branch from GitHub or using the docker image bostrot/telegram-support-bot:4.0.0.

Start it.

The old database should work with the new version without changing anything.

### Upgrading to v3.0.0

The latest version uses a new config file in YAML format which would break old versions.

In order to make old versions work with the master you would need to use the new config.yaml file instead of the config.ts file from before. The easiest would be if you copy the config-sample.yaml to config.yaml (both in the config folder) and edit the settings similar to your old config.ts file. There is no need to delete the database file so old tickets can be kept open.
